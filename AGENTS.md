# AGENTS.md

Agent-focused guidance for this repository ([AGENTS.md format](https://agents.md/)). Human-facing docs live in `README.md`.

## Project overview

Google Scholar scraper and Flask API (`RummerLab/scholar`). Runtime deps: `requirements.txt`. Lint/test deps: `requirements-dev.txt` (includes runtime via `-r requirements.txt`).

## Setup commands

```bash
python -m venv scholar
# Windows: scholar\Scripts\activate
source scholar/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt   # ruff + pytest
```

Secrets: copy `.env.template` → `.env`. Never commit `.env` or `google-credentials.json` (both gitignored).

## Lint and format (mandatory)

After every edit to Python files, before considering a task complete:

```bash
ruff check . --fix && ruff format .
```

Or: `python -m ruff check . --fix && python -m ruff format .`

- `ruff check .` — lint (`--fix` where possible)
- `ruff format .` — format
- Fix any remaining Ruff issues before finishing

## Testing

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest tests/ -v
# CI excludes integration tests:
pytest tests/ -m "not integration"
```

Add or update tests for code you change. Fix failures before finishing.

## Code quality

- Refactor when touching code; remove dead code and obsolete files; keep the repo lean
- Prefer small, focused modules; clear names (`get_doi_from_url` not `fetch`); type hints where helpful
- DRY: extract shared helpers when the same block appears 2+ times
- Error handling: catch explicitly; log and re-raise or return meaningful values
- Comments explain *why*, not *what*; docstrings for public functions
- Python: PEP 8 (Ruff), `snake_case` / `PascalCase`, prefer `pathlib` where practical
- Path containment under user-influenced dirs: use `src.path_safety.safe_path_under` (CodeQL-friendly `realpath` + `startswith`), not only `Path.resolve` / `relative_to`

## README and docs

`README.md` is the primary human documentation. Keep it accurate when you change:

- Features, scripts, setup, env vars (also `.env.template`), API, dependencies, Docker/run commands

Checklist: working examples, current install steps, remove outdated sections.

## Security

- Do not commit secrets, tokens, or service-account JSON
- Do not weaken path/DOI validation without a security-minded reason
- Prefer rotating credentials if they may have been exposed

## Maintaining this file

Treat `AGENTS.md` as living agent docs (replaces former `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`):

- Add guidance when recurring patterns, tooling, or pitfalls emerge
- Update when standards change; remove redundant or conflicting text
- Keep sections focused and actionable; prefer concrete commands over vague advice
