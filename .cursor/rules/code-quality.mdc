# Code Quality and Best Practices

## Refactoring and Cleanup

- **Always refactor** when touching code: improve structure, naming, and readability
- **Remove dead code** — delete unused functions, classes, imports, and files
- **Delete obsolete files** — if a module or script is superseded, remove it (don’t leave legacy code)
- **Keep the repo lean** — avoid cruft; aim for a codebase that’s easy to understand and maintain
- **Clean as you go** — when adding or changing code, tidy related areas and fix nearby issues

## Senior Developer Standards

- Write code that a new teammate can understand without hand-holding
- Prefer small, focused modules over large monoliths
- Use clear abstractions; avoid clever tricks that obscure intent
- Document non-obvious behavior; keep the code itself as the primary documentation

## DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

- Extract repeated logic into reusable functions or modules
- If the same block appears 2+ times, refactor into a shared helper
- Prefer composition over copy-paste

## Best Practices

- **Functions**: Keep them focused; one responsibility per function
- **Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names (`get_doi_from_url` not `fetch`)
- **Error handling**: Handle exceptions explicitly; log and re-raise or return meaningful values
- **Type hints**: Add type annotations to function signatures where helpful
- **Imports**: Remove unused imports; avoid duplicates; group stdlib, third-party, local
- **Comments**: Explain *why*, not *what*; keep docstrings for public functions

## Python Conventions

- Follow PEP 8 (enforced by Ruff)
- Use `snake_case` for functions/variables, `PascalCase` for classes
- Prefer pathlib over os.path for file operations where practical
