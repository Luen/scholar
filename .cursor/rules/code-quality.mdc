# Code Quality and Best Practices

## DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

- Extract repeated logic into reusable functions or modules
- If the same block appears 2+ times, refactor into a shared helper
- Prefer composition over copy-paste

## Best Practices

- **Functions**: Keep them focused; one responsibility per function
- **Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names (`get_doi_from_url` not `fetch`)
- **Error handling**: Handle exceptions explicitly; log and re-raise or return meaningful values
- **Type hints**: Add type annotations to function signatures where helpful
- **Imports**: Remove unused imports; avoid duplicates; group stdlib, third-party, local
- **Comments**: Explain *why*, not *what*; keep docstrings for public functions

## Python Conventions

- Follow PEP 8 (enforced by Ruff)
- Use `snake_case` for functions/variables, `PascalCase` for classes
- Prefer pathlib over os.path for file operations where practical
