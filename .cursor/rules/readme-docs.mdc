# README as Documentation

## Importance

The README is the primary project documentation. Keep it accurate and current.

## When to Update

- **New features or scripts** — Document usage, options, and examples
- **Changed setup** — Update installation steps, env vars, or prerequisites
- **API changes** — Update endpoint docs, parameters, and examples
- **Dependency changes** — Update requirements list and install instructions
- **Docker/run changes** — Update commands and workflow

## Checklist

- Installation and setup reflect current state
- Examples use valid, working commands
- New environment variables documented (e.g. in .env.template)
- Broken or outdated sections removed or revised
