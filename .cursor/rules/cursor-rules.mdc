# Cursor Rules Maintenance

## Proactive Rule Updates

- **Add new rules** when recurring patterns, conventions, or pitfalls emerge
- **Update existing rules** when project standards or tooling change
- **Remove or merge rules** that become redundant or conflicting

## When to Add or Update Rules

- New tools (linters, formatters, test runners) adopted
- Team or project conventions established
- Common mistakes or fixes identified
- Documentation or workflow changes that affect AI assistance

## Rule Location

Rules live in `.cursor/rules/` as `.mdc` files with YAML frontmatter.

## Process

1. Identify a pattern or standard worth encoding
2. Create or edit a rule in `.cursor/rules/`
3. Use `alwaysApply: true` for project-wide rules
4. Use `globs: **/*.py` (etc.) for file-specific rules
5. Keep each rule focused and under ~50 lines
